Based on the provided information, I will create a simple chatbot GUI using PyQt6 with the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `ChatbotModel`: This class will handle the chatbot's data and logic.
   - `save_chat_history`: Save the chat history to a file.
   - `load_chat_history`: Load the chat history from a file.
   - `add_message`: Add a message to the chat history.

2. `ChatbotView`: This class will handle the chatbot's GUI.
   - `create_widgets`: Create the necessary widgets for the chatbot GUI.
   - `update_conversation`: Update the conversation window with new messages.

3. `ChatbotController`: This class will handle the communication between the model and the view.
   - `send_message`: Process user input and update the conversation window.
   - `save_chat_history`: Save the chat history to a file.
   - `load_chat_history`: Load the chat history from a file.

Now, let's create the code for each file.

main.py
